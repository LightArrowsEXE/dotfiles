# Light's Configs

Configuration files for my system.
This used to be my Arch dotfiles,
but has now been made more generic.

Recommendations for settings to change are always welcome,
so feel free to send in a [pull request](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/dotfiles/pulls).

## License

My custom configuration files (like `mpv.conf`) are licensed under MIT,
and thus modification and redistribution are allowed.
Other third-party files may be subject to their own licenses
and may in some instances need to be acquired separately
to make full use of my configurations.
If a third-party developer wishes for me to remove their code,
please contact me on Discord
or send in an [issue](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/dotfiles/issues/new).
